# ðŸªž Retrospectives

Retros are where teams reflect, grow, and strengthen trust. Hereâ€™s how I structure effective, low-drama retros.

## Format (60 mins)
1. **Check-In (5 min):** Quick pulse or emoji check-in
2. **What went well? (15 min)**
3. **What didnâ€™t go well? (15 min)**
4. **Ideas & Improvements (15 min)**
5. **Actions & Owners (10 min)**

## Tools
- Virtual whiteboards (Miro, FigJam)
- Google Docs or Notion
- Sticky notes if in person

## Tips for Better Retros
- Keep it blameless
- Use a facilitator (not always the manager)
- Rotate formats to keep it fresh
- Follow up on action items next time
