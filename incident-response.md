# ðŸš¨ Incident Response Framework

Structured and calm incident response creates confidence during chaos.

## War Room Playbook

1. **Acknowledge the issue** in public channels (Slack/Teams)
2. **Create a dedicated incident channel** (e.g., #incident-1234)
3. **Assign Roles:**
   - Incident Lead
   - Comms Lead
   - Scribe / Timeline

4. **Document a timeline** with key decisions and updates
5. **Post-mortem** within 24â€“48 hours
