# ðŸš¨ Escalation Process

Clear escalation paths help reduce customer friction and keep teams focused under pressure. Here's a framework I use to define when, how, and who to escalate to.

## When to Escalate
- SLA or response deadline at risk
- Customer is highly dissatisfied or at risk of churn
- Issue blocks a release, deployment, or key process
- Involves cross-team coordination or unknowns

## Escalation Tiers
### Tier 1: Internal Support
- Peer review
- Knowledge base / runbook
- Escalation buddy / senior team member

### Tier 2: Team Lead / Manager
- Jump in if Tier 1 cannot resolve in expected time
- Ensure coordination across teams
- Communicate updates to stakeholders

### Tier 3: Executive / Cross-Org
- Used for outages, VIP clients, or revenue-critical blockers
- Executive sponsor looped in
- War room activated if needed

## Best Practices
- Escalate early, not late
- Document everything in ticket or incident timeline
- Focus on facts, not blame
- Communicate frequently and clearly
