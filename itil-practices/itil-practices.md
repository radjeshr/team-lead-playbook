# ITIL-Inspired Practices in Team Leadership

This document outlines how I've adapted ITIL principles in my leadership work to improve team structure, responsiveness, and customer satisfaction.

## 🧯 Incident Management
Created a lightweight escalation framework that supports both internal handoffs and executive escalations — reducing resolution times by ~40%.

## 📦 Service Request Management
Developed onboarding workflows that mirror request fulfillment — clear ownership, timely delivery, and quality assurance checklists.

## ♻️ Continual Improvement
Run monthly retrospectives and service review check-ins with cross-functional teams to identify recurring issues and propose tactical improvements.

## 🤝 Service Level & Operational Agreements
Defined internal expectations through team SLAs/OLAs to align effort with stakeholder priorities — documented in team charters.

> These ITIL principles are translated into people-first practices that work in modern SaaS and agile environments.
