# PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Act)

PDCA is a foundational framework used in service management to drive iterative improvements in operations, team performance, and customer outcomes.

## What is PDCA?

PDCA stands for:
- **Plan**: Identify a problem or improvement opportunity, define objectives, and create an action plan.
- **Do**: Execute the plan on a small scale.
- **Check**: Review the results against expected outcomes.
- **Act**: Standardize successful practices or revise the approach based on lessons learned.
