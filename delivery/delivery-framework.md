# ðŸ“¦ Delivery Framework

My approach to delivery focuses on transparency, predictability, and velocity â€” without unnecessary complexity.

## Core Principles
1. **Outcomes over output**
2. **Small, fast feedback loops**
3. **Clear ownership and accountability**
4. **Transparency across stakeholders**

## Delivery Cadence
- Weekly or bi-weekly planning sync
- Standups (daily or 2â€“3x/week)
- Mid-sprint health check
- End-of-sprint demo or review

## Work Tracking
- Tasks grouped by themes or epics
- Visual board (Jira / Linear / Trello)
- Clear definitions of "Ready" and "Done"

## Risk Management
- Highlight blockers early
- Track risks in shared doc or board
- Escalate if any risk exceeds defined thresholds

## Metrics to Track
- Cycle time
- Sprint predictability (% of committed vs delivered)
- Team satisfaction (pulse surveys)
