## 📘 ITIL-Inspired Practices

Many of the frameworks in this playbook are influenced by ITIL best practices, especially around service delivery and operations. My hands-on experience with ITIL helps me bridge theory and practice in real-world, fast-paced environments.

Key ITIL-aligned principles in this playbook:
- 🔄 **Incident and Escalation Management** — aligned with ITIL’s Incident Management to restore service quickly.
- 📥 **Request Fulfillment** — onboarding checklists that mirror structured request handling.
- 🎯 **Continual Service Improvement (CSI)** — embedded in team retrospectives and feedback loops.
- 📋 **Operational Level Agreements (OLAs)** — defined expectations through team charters and internal SLAs.

While this isn't a formal ITIL manual, it reflects how I’ve applied the framework pragmatically in team leadership and support operations.
