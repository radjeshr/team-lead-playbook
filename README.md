# Team Lead Playbook

Welcome! This repository is a collection of frameworks, checklists, and processes I've refined over the years while working as a Support Manager, Delivery Manager, and Technical Project Manager. It's designed to help build high-performing, engaged, and reliable teams — especially in fast-paced, customer-facing environments.

## 📘 ITIL-Inspired Practices

Many of the frameworks in this playbook are influenced by ITIL best practices, especially around service delivery and operations. My hands-on experience with ITIL helps me bridge theory and practice in real-world, fast-paced environments.

Key ITIL-aligned principles in this playbook:
- 🔄 **Incident and Escalation Management** — aligned with ITIL’s Incident Management to restore service quickly.
- 📥 **Request Fulfillment** — onboarding checklists that mirror structured request handling.
- 🎯 **Continual Service Improvement (CSI)** — embedded in team retrospectives and feedback loops.
- 📋 **Operational Level Agreements (OLAs)** — defined expectations through team charters and internal SLAs.

🎓 I hold the **ITIL® Expert Certificate in IT Service Management** along with all intermediate certifications across the lifecycle and capability streams (Service Strategy, Transition, Operations, CSI, etc.).

While this isn't a formal ITIL manual, it reflects how I’ve applied the framework pragmatically in team leadership and support operations.
