# üîÅ Team Rituals

Rituals create structure, foster culture, and build momentum. Here are a few I use to keep teams aligned and energized.

## Weekly
- **Team Standup (15 min):** Quick sync on priorities and blockers
- **Demo Friday or Show & Tell:** Celebrate progress, however small
- **One-on-One Check-ins:** Rotating, 30 min per team member

## Monthly
- **Retrospective:** Reflect on wins, misses, and improvements
- **Health Check Survey:** How are we doing? How do we feel?
- **Learning Lunch or Knowledge Share**

## Quarterly
- **Goal Review (OKRs or Themes)**
- **Team Offsite or Workshop**
- **Career & Growth Conversations**
